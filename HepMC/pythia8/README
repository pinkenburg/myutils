Pythia8 is a rather different than Pythia6.  The Pythia8 source
distribution contains an "examples" subdirectory with a slew of
example main programs you can compile and run.  They each illustrate
different ways you might want to run Pythia. It's a bit overwhelming.
There's one, main42.cc, that covers a pretty broad range of how we in
PHENIX might want to use Pythia.  It reads its configuration from an
input file and writes a HepMC formatted file as output. 

This collection of code just packages up main42.cc so that it can be
compiled and run straightforwardly.  The file pythia8_parameters lists
all of the available things you can change in the Pythia8 input file.
The file example_input shows one example of what you might do.  When
Pythia8 runs, it needs to be able to find a bunch of XML documents
that, in the Pythia8 distribution, is in the subdirectory xmldoc.  Set
the environment variable "PYTHIA8DATA" to point to this directory.

Other than that, it's just autogen.sh, make, make install.
